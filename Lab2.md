_1. Grammars: Synthetic Examples._

A ::= A & A | V

V ::= a | b

**Solutions**
**(a)**

               S1 is in AObjects S2 is in AObjects
            -----------------------------------------
                      S1 & S2 in AObjects
                      
                         S is in VObjects
                     ------------------------
                         S is in AObjects

**(b)**

				Because V => a or b, therefore:
						A => A & A
						A => (A & A) & (A & A)
						A => a & a & a & a
						
				This is ambiguous 
				
				Also:
						A => (A & A) & V
						A => (V & (A & A) & V)
						A => (a & (V & V) & a)
						A => (a & (a & a) & a)
						A => a & a & a & a
						
			    This too is ambiguous
			 
**(c)**

			L(S) = { a^n, b^n, c^n; n >= 0 }
			L(A) = { a^n; n >= 1  }
			L(B) = { b^m; m >= 0 }
			L(C) = { c^n; n >= 1  }
			
**(d)**


	1. baab
		
		   S ::= AaBb => baBb because A => b 
		              => baab because B => a
		   
		   baab is in the language
		   
	 
	    
	2. bbbab
	    

	       This grammar ensures all sentences derived from contain more than one 'a' sequentially.
	       Since B => aB or a,  AND S ::= AaBb, the grammar S already contains a single 'a' 
	       S ::= AaBb => AbaBb since A => Ab
					  => AbbaBb 
					  => bbbaBb since A => b
					  => bbbaab since B => a
					  
		since   L(S) = { (b)^n(a)^m(b)^k; n >= 1  m > 1  k = 1 }
		        
		bbbab IS NOT IN the language 
		
		
	3. bbaaaaa
		
	       S ::= AaBb => AbaBb since A => Ab
					  => bbaBb since A => b
					  => bbaaBb since B => aB
					  => bbaaaBb => (b)^2(a)^5(b)^1 since B => aB or a
		
		   This grammar makes sure the string terminates in 'b' NOT 'a'. 
		   
		        L(S) = { (b)^n(a)^m(b)^k; n >= 1  m > 1  k = 1 }
		   
		   Therefore, bbaaaaa IS NOT IN the language generated by the
		   above grammar.
		 
		   
	4. bbaab
		
		S ::= AaBb => AbaBb since A => Ab | b
					    => bbaBb 
					    => bbaab since B => aB | a
		
		   baab IS IN the language
